                        <h3>
                            Since the invention of computers, people have been using the term "Data" to refer to
                            Computer
                            Information, either transmitted or stored. However, there is data that exists in order types
                            as
                            well. Data can be numbers or texts written on a piece of paper, in the form of bits and
                            bytes
                            stored inside the memory of electronic devices, or facts stored within a person's mind. As
                            the
                            world started modernizing, this data became a significant aspect of everyone's day-to-day
                            life,
                            and various implementations allowed them to store it differently.<br><br>

                            Data is a collection of facts and figures or a set of values or values of a specific format
                            that
                            refers to a single set of item values. The data items are then classified into sub-items,
                            which
                            is the group of items that are not known as the simple primary form of the item.<br><br>
                            Data Structure is a branch of Computer Science. The study of data structure allows us to
                            understand the organization of data and the management of the data flow in order to increase
                            the
                            efficiency of any process or program. Data Structure is a particular way of storing and
                            organizing data in the memory of the computer so that these data can easily be retrieved and
                            efficiently utilized in the future when required. The data can be managed in various ways,
                            like
                            the logical or mathematical model for a specific organization of data is known as a data
                            structure

                            data
                            in a way that allows for efficient retrieval, manipulation, and storage of data. For
                            example, using a hash table to store data can provide constant-time access to data.</h3>

                        end and deleted from the other end. A good example of the queue is any queue of consumers for a
                        resource where the consumer that came first is served first. The difference between stacks and
                        queues is in removing. In a stack we remove the item the most recently added; in a queue, we

                                items
                                in reverse order. For example, the popular sorting algorithm quicksort uses a singly
                                linked
                                list to store the list of items that need to be sorted. By processing the list in
                                reverse
                                order, quicksort can sort the list more efficiently.

                            <h3>A linked list is a data structure that stores a sequence of elements. Each element in
                                the list is called a node, and each node has a reference to the next node in the list.
                                The first node in the list is called the head, and the last node in the list is called
                                the tail.<br>

                                To create a singly linked list, we first need to create a node class. Each node will
                                have two data members: an integer value and a reference to the next node in the list.
                                Next, we need to create a LinkedList class. This class will have two data members: a
                                head node and a tail node. The head node will store the first element in the list, and
                                the tail node will store the last element in the list.<br>

                                To add an element to the list, we need to create a new node and set the next reference
                                of the previous tail node to point to the new node. Then, we can set the new node as the
                                new tail of the list.<br>

                                To remove an element from the list, we need to find the node that contains the value
                                that we want to remove. We can do this by traversing the list until we find the node
                                with the matching value. Once we find the node, we need to set the next reference of the
                                previous node to point to the next node. To search for an element in the list, we need
                                to traverse the list until we find the node with the matching value. To traverse the
                                list, we can start at the head node and follow the next references until we reach the
                                tail node.</h3>

                                A doubly linked list of singly linked lists is a data structure that consists of a set
                                of singly linked lists (SLLs), each of which is doubly linked. It is used to store data
                                in a way that allows for fast insertion and deletion of elements.<br>

                                Each SLL is made up of two parts: a head and a tail. The head of each SLL contains a
                                pointer to the first element in the list, and the tail contains a pointer to the last
                                element.<br>

                                It is advantageous over other data structures because it allows for quick insertion and
                                deletion of elements. Additionally, it is easy to implement and can be used in a variety
                                of applications.<br>

                            <h3>A doubly linked list is a type of data structure that allows for the storage of data in
                                a linear fashion, much like a singly linked list. However, unlike a singly linked list,
                                a doubly linked list allows for both forward and backward traversal of the data stored
                                within it. This makes it an ideal data structure for applications that require the
                                ability to move both forward and backward through a list of data.<br>

                                To create a doubly linked list, we first need to create a Node class that will be used
                                to store our data. This Node class will have two attributes: data and next. The data
                                attribute will be used to store the actual data that we want to store in our list, and
                                the next attribute will be used to store a reference to the next node in the list.<br>

                                Once we have our Node class, we can create our doubly linked list. To do this, we need
                                to create a class that will represent our list. This class will have two attributes:
                                head and tail. The head attribute will be used to store a reference to the first node in
                                our list, and the tail attribute will be used to store a reference to the last node in
                                our list.<br>

                                After the list class is created, we can begin adding data to it. To add data to our
                                list, we need to create a new node and set its data attribute to the data that we want
                                to add. Then, we need to set the next attribute of the new node to point to the head
                                node of our list. Finally, we need to set the head node of our list to point to the new
                                node.<br>

                                Now that we know how to add data to our list, we can write a function to traverse our
                                list. To do this, we need to create a variable that will keep track of the current node
                                that we are traversing. We can set this variable to the head node of our list to start.
                                Then, we need to create a while loop that will continue until the current node is None,
                                which indicates that we have reached the end of our list.

                                Within our while loop, we need to print out the data that is stored in the current node.
                                Then, we need to set the current node to the next node in our list before continuing to
                                the next iteration of the loop.</h3>
